## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
d<-read_csv("_DataPublic_/vdem/1984_2022/vdem_1984_2022_external.csv")
```
Subset data by row
```{r}
# Want: 
d_gdp |> filter(Year >= 2000 & Year <-2022)
```


```{r}
d_gdp |> filter(Country = "China")
```

```{r}
d_gdp |> filter(Year >= 2000 & Year<= 2005) |> filter(Country = "China")
```

#Arrange
```{r}
#Want: sort the row by GDP per capita
d_gdp|>arrange(GDP_per_capita)
```

```{r}
d_gdp |> arrange(-GDP_per_capita)
```
